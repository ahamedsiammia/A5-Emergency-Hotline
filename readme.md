3. What is *Event Bubbling* and how does it work?

Ans-3: When an event happens on an element, it first runs on that element and then automatically propagates upward through its parent elements.

4. What is *Event Delegation* in JavaScript? Why is it useful?

Ans-4: Event Delegation id a  technique where you add an event listener to a parent element to handle events on its child elements using event bubbling — useful for better performance and handling dynamically added elements.

5. What is the difference between *preventDefault() and stopPropagation()* methods?
